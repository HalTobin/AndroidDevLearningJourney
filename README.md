## School Projects
### n°1 Entrevoisins
Develop new functionalities within an existing project. The main goal is to become familiar with Android’s XML and Activities. The application allows users to view a list of neighbors, see their profiles, and add them to favorites (non-persistent data).
<ul>
   <li>Use of Android XML</li>
   <li>Creation of Android Activities</li>
</ul>

### n°2 Mareu
Develop a simple application from scratch. The main goal is to learn how to build a basic application. The application allows users to register a meeting, defined by various data such as a title, room, participants, etc. (non-persistent data).

Learned:
<ul>
   <li>Develop an Android app from scratch</li>
</ul>

### n°3 Todoc
Implement a database in an existing project. The main goal is to learn about repositories, the Room library, and ORM usage. The application allows users to register a new task and mark it as completed (persistent data).

Learned:
<ul>
   <li>Use of repositories</li>
   <li>Room library</li>
   <li>LiveData</li>
</ul>

### n°4 Go4Lunch
Develop an application using web APIs from scratch. The goal is to learn about web APIs (Google Places API with Retrofit), implement Google Maps SDK, use a backend (Firebase for the database), authentication (FireAuth), explore MVVM architecture, and use ViewModels. The app displays a map with the user’s location and nearby restaurants, allowing users to see details and plan lunch with colleagues (data saved in Firebase).

Learned and used:
<ul>
   <li>Usage of REST API</li>
   <li>Retrofit library</li>
   <li>Google's Places API</li>
   <li>Google Map SDK</li>
   <li>MVVM Architecture</li>
   <li>ViewModels</li>
   <li>FireAuth</li>
   <li>Firebase</li>
</ul>

### n°5 RealEstateManager
Develop an application from scratch to review all previously learned skills. This project was also an opportunity to learn Kotlin for Android development.

Learned:
<ul>
   <li>Kotlin</li>
   <li>Flow</li>
</ul>

## Personal Projects
### MusicRange
Developing a music player and try out the Spotify Auth SDK.

Used:
<ul>
   <li>MVVM Architecture</li>
   <li>Spotify Auth SDK</li>
   <li>Media playback</li>
</ul>

### MiaVortoj
Develop a flashcard application: create new dictionaries for the languages you’re learning and save difficult words to generate tests based on “Spaced Repetition”. This project was an opportunity to learn Clean Architecture, Jetpack Compose, and consolidate my Kotlin knowledge.

Used:
<ul>
   <li>MVVM Architecture</li>
   <li>Jetpack Compose</li>
   <li>Clean Architecture</li>
</ul>

### BudgetCalculator
A simple application to predict yearly and monthly expenses. Users can register regular incomes and expenses, and the app calculates savings needed for the month or year based on outcomes and available funds. This was also an opportunity to explore MVP architecture.

Used:
<ul>
   <li>MVP Architecture</li>
</ul>

### PocketLocker
Using encryption and decryption libraries. Allow an user to create fully secured albums photos: crypted within the app and each album can only be unlock and decrypted with password defined by the user.
